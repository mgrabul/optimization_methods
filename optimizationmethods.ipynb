    "The book contains three chapters. It begins with a basic introduction to Python, followed by linear algebra concepts and their implementation in Python. In the final chapter, foundational optimization algorithms are introduced, where all previously explained concepts and developed algorithms are put to use. This structured progression allows readers to build essential Python skills for mathematical applications, establishing a solid foundation for understanding basic optimization algorithms. It also serves as a valuable introduction to using Python for various mathematical tasks and projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific attention is maintained on a structured approach where the code is modular and reusable. The recursive nature of optimization methods is illustrated through this modular design, and Python's functional programming capabilities are leveraged by passing functions as arguments to define iteration logic, convergence criteria, and method-specific computations. This approach allows the mathematical relationships within each algorithm to be clearly represented, emphasizing both reusability and the structural similarities and differences across methods. The methods are developed gradually, with more complex techniques relying on functions initially crafted for simpler methods, reinforcing understanding through progressive complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire code is designed to be executed in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, offering readers an interactive environment to experiment with each optimization technique. This hands-on approach not only deepens understanding but also makes Python a practical tool for mathematical and optimization-based applications."

    "Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language. It was invented in the late '80s, and its current major version is 3. Important features and characteristics of Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Object-oriented\n",

    "Python code is interpreted, meaning it is transformed into byte code one line at a time during execution. There is no separate compile phase, so no compile time is needed. Popular uses of Python include scripting and automation, microservices, statistics, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its open-source nature and well-developed libraries for computation and visualization, such as NumPy and Matplotlib, Python has become quite popular in math-related fields, especially in universities and academia. It has increasingly replaced previously well-established software like \"Wolfram Mathematica\" and \"MATLAB.\""

In contrast, imperative programming uses loops like `while` or `for` to iterate over data structures. More detailed examples will be shown in the functions section of this seminar work.\n",

Libraries are collections of modules, and modules are collections of functions and classes that are used for similar purposes. The math library needs to be imported before it is used. To do so, write `import math` before using it. Once imported, the functions and classes inside the library can be used by accessing them with dot notation. For example, `math.sqrt(9)` will return 3 as it calculates the square root of nine.\n",

To define an alias for the module `matplotlib.pyplot`, the following code line can be used: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.\n",

    "**Absolute Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "The absolute value using NumPy can be calculated with `np.abs(<np.array>)` or `abs(x)`. The `np.abs` function is used on a NumPy array and returns an array where all elements are positive.\n",

    "A one-dimensional polynomial function is defined as:\n",
    "$$f(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k \\cdot x^k$$\n",
    "Using the NumPy library, a polynomial function can be created with `np.poly1d`, where the $a_k, 0 \\leq k \\leq n$ are elements of a `np.array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derivatives**\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, the derivative of a polynomial function is:\n",
    "$$f'(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\cdot a_k \\cdot x^{k-1}$$\n",
    "and the derivative of a polynomial function `f` can be found using `np.polyder(f)` where `f=np.poly1d(<np.array>)`.\n",

    "Except for calculating derivatives of polynomial functions, NumPy does not offer a function to calculate the derivative of any function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us two popular options for calculating a derivative of a general function:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom function\n",
    "Write a function to calculate the derivative according to the definition of a derivative. The function `derivative_of` does exactly this and can differentiate any one-dimensional Python function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "The function `derivative_of` returns a function and as so supports higher-order derivatives. Additional advantage of this method is that no additional library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "The function `derivative_of` supports only one dimensional functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*derivative_of can be only used with used with mathematical function, take a number as an input and return a number as an output*\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Sympy`-library\n",
    "The `sympy` library's `sympy.diff` function with `sympy.symbols` is the most general and flexible solution for symbolic differentiation. It allows the calculation of the derivative of a function and can be used to calculate higher-order derivatives (second, third, etc.). It can also be used to calculate partial derivatives of a multi-dimensional function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "It supports higher-order and partial derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "It can't operate on standard Python functions but requires a special variable type (symbolic objects). Instead of creating a standard Python function for the mathematical function whose derivative is required, a symbolic object representing the mathematical function is created. The operations of differentiation are then performed on this object.\n",
    "\n",
    "My suggestion is to use the `derivative_of` function whenever possible and to use `sympy.diff` for multi-dimensional functions. Note that `sympy.diff` is not used in this seminar work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integrals**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy also does not offer functions for calculating bounded integrals or integrals in general; they need to be calculated manually. The `scipy.integrate` library can be used for approximation. Use `scipy.integrate.nquad` for single-value functions and for functions with more than one variable, and use `scipy.integrate.trapz` for functions with more than one dimension. Note that Integrals are not required or used in this seminar work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In general, multi-purpose programming languages do not offer methods or libraries that can manipulate mathematical functions. They usually offer a way to approximate them, perhaps because mathematical functions are not a standard type of variable in general-purpose languages.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the first derivative of the polynomial function $f(x) = 2*x^2 + 3*x -5$ and evaluate it in $x = 3$.\n",

By solving $q'(x)=0$ or $f'(x_k) + f''(x_k)*(x-x_k)=0$ it finds the local extreme of the function $q(x)$. This solution $x_k+1$ is the new approximation, and the step is repeated until some stop condition is reached*"

    "## Gradient method\n",
    "The Gradient method is used to approximate an extremum of a function $f$. Similar to the Newton method, it requires the knowledge of the derivative of $f$ in the approximation steps $\\pmb{x^{(0)}}, \\pmb{x^{(1)}}...$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given $f(\\pmb{x}) = c, \\pmb{x} \\in \\pmb{R}^n$, and  $ c \\in \\pmb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The gradient of $f$ at $\\pmb{x_0}$ is a vector in $\\textbf{R}^n$, denoted by $\\nabla f(\\pmb{x_0})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\nabla f(\\pmb{x_0})$ points in the direction of the maximum rate of increase of $f(\\pmb{x})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $-\\nabla f(\\pmb{x_0})$ points in the direction of the maximum rate of decrease of $f(\\pmb{x})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a starting value $\\pmb{x^{(k_0)}}$, the value $\\pmb{x^{(k+1)}}$ will be a \"move\" in the direction of the local minimum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pmb{x^{(k+1)}} = \\pmb{x^{(k)}} - \\alpha_k \\nabla f(\\pmb{x^{(k)}})\n",

    "For a starting the value $x\\pmb{^{(k_0)}}$, the value $\\pmb{x^{(k+1)}}$ will be a \"move\" in the direction of the local maximum:\n",

    "The scalar $\\alpha_k$ is the $\\textit{step size}$ and is always bigger than 0. Different variations of the algorithm exist, that use different strategies to re-calculated $\\alpha$ on every iteration. Correctly choosing $\\alpha$ is quite important, picking a random $\\alpha$ might not result in convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the previous example, where approximation was done on a one-dimensional function, the following gradient method algorithm approximates an n-dimensional function. As a result, the steps $\\pmb{x^{(0)}}, \\pmb{x^{(1)}}, \\ldots$ are n-dimensional dots/vectors. Consequently, the algorithm stops when the distance between $\\pmb{x^{(k)}}$ and $\\pmb{x^{(k+1)}}$ is smaller than a given accuracy, or when the norm of the vector $\\| \\pmb{x^{(k)}} - \\pmb{x^{(k+1)}} \\|$ is smaller than a required accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate how to solve the previous linear program using the `linprog` library\n",

    "#          Minimize :\n",
    "#                     2x_1 + 3x_2\n",
    "#        Subject to :\n",
    "#                     4x_1 + 2x_2 >= 12\n",
    "#                      x_1 + 4x_2 >= 6\n",

    "1. Initially transform the linear program so it is a minimizer.\n",
    "2. Create a list of all coefficients from the optimization function needs for example $2x_1 + 3x_2$ becomes `c=[-2,-3]`.\n",
    "3. Create matrix $A$, this are the parameters defined by the values before the $x$ variables under the subject part of the program, but not including the last row. In this case, the parameters will form the following matrix `A = [[-4, -2], [-1, -4]]`, it is important to point out that the sight before every parameter depends on the inequality operation or equality of the row.\n",
    "In case of:\n",
    "* \\>= the sign of the parameters changes in the entire row changes\n",
    "* <= the sign of the parameters  stays the same in the entire row.\n",
    "* == A new matrix A_eq is created that contains this row, and will be plugged in the function separately.\n",
    "* in case of < or >, manual work is required, as these rows are not excepted by the algorithm, by adding/removing a small number $e$ to the requeued row in the B-vector column.\n",
    "4. Constructing the vector B, this is the last column of the linear program. In the current linear program it is the vector B=[12,6]. It has the same number of elements or rows as the matrix A. Also it follows the same rules as a concerning the inequality or equality operator.\n",
